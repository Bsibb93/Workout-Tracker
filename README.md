# Pocket Lifts (PWA)

A tiny offline workout tracker you can install on your iPhone via **Add to Home Screen**.

## Quick Start — GitHub Pages (No code required)

1. **Unzip** this folder on your computer so you have these files visible (e.g., `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, etc.).
2. Go to https://github.com and **Sign in** (or create an account).
3. Click **New** repository → name it anything (e.g., `pocket-lifts`). Keep it **Public**.
4. On the new repo page, click **Add file → Upload files**.
5. **Drag & drop all files** from this folder into GitHub’s upload area (don’t upload the zip – upload the individual files).
6. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages** (left sidebar).
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Under **Branch**, select **main** and **/** (root), then **Save**.
4. Wait ~30–90 seconds for GitHub Pages to deploy. A **URL** will appear at the top of the Pages section like:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`

### Install on iPhone

1. Open the Pages URL in **Safari** on your iPhone.
2. Tap **Share** → **Add to Home Screen** → **Add**.
3. Launch **Pocket Lifts** from your home screen. It will work **offline** after the first load.

## Notes

- Data is saved **locally** on your device (no account required).
- To export data, open the **History** tab and click **Export CSV**.
- If you change files later, GitHub Pages updates automatically. Re-open the app to refresh.
- The `.nojekyll` file disables Jekyll processing, which avoids issues with certain asset paths.

## Optional — Using GitHub Desktop

1. Install **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Create a repo on GitHub, then **Open in GitHub Desktop**.
3. Copy these files into the local repo folder.
4. **Commit & Push** to publish.
5. Enable **Pages** in **Settings → Pages** as shown above.

Enjoy!
